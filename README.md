# PySweeper
## Description
PySweeper is an open-source MineSweeper game implemented in Python, through the Tkinter Interface. I have been developing it during my college lessons.

## How To Run
Start by running **install_requirements.bat**. This will create the python environment needed to run PySweeper. It then installs Tkinter and creates **run.bat**.
### **!!ONLY RUN INSTALL_REQUIREMENTS ONCE!!**
Once you have, only use run.bat to run the program.
